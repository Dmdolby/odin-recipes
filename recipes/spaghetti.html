   <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>It's spaghetti. What more do you want!?</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 small bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>Salt/Pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>14.5 oz. diced tomatoes, undrained</li>
            <li>1/2 pound spaghetti, uncooked</li>
            <li>24 oz. marinara sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cream cheese, optional</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook and crumble the ground beef and onions over medium-high heat until nearly cooked through. Add the diced peppers, garlic, and seasonings during the last 2-3 minutes. Set aside on a separate plate and drain any grease.</li>
            <li>Add chicken broth to the pot and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the brown spots on the bottom. Bring the broth to a boil. Add the uncooked spaghetti noodles and use kitchen tongs to twist the noodles into the pot as they soften. Once softened, add the undrained diced tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Add the marinara sauce and softened cream cheese. Submerge the pasta underneath. Cover partially and simmer until cooked through, the pasta will take about 15-20 minutes total. Periodically run a silicone spatula along the bottom of the pot to ensure the pasta doesn’t stick.</li>
            <li>Add the meat back to the sauce and heat through. Serve with garlic bread with cheese.</li>
        </ol>
