   <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Musroom Risotto is a delicious comfort food. It reminds me of home.</p>
        <p>This risotto is not as hard to make as you might think.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons EVOO</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds mixed mushrooms, chopped</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoons sea salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups uncooked Arborio rice, rinsed</li>
            <li>2/3 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>5 cups warmed vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated pecorino or parmesan cheese, plus more for serving</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a Dutch oven or large, deep skillet over medium heat. Add the mushrooms, ½ teaspoon of the salt, and several grinds of pepper and toss to coat. Cook, stirring only occasionally, for 8 minutes, or until soft and browned. Remove from the pan and set aside. Work in batches if necessary.</li>
            <li>Wipe out the pan and return it to the heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, the onion, and the remaining ¼ teaspoon sea salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 8 minutes, or until softened. Stir in the garlic, thyme, and rice. Let cook for 1 minute, then add the wine. Stir and cook for 1 to 3 minutes, or until the wine cooks down.</li>
            <li>Add the broth ¾ cup at a time, stirring constantly and allowing each addition of broth to be absorbed before adding the next. With the final addition of broth, stir two-thirds of the sautéed mushrooms into the risotto. Cook until the risotto is creamy and the rice has a slight al dente bite. Stir in the cheese and season to taste.</li>
            <li>Top with the remaining sautéed mushrooms, garnish with parsley, and serve with more grated cheese, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
